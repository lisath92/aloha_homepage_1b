##Aloha HomePage - Updated version

###About
This is a project website given by RED Academy Web Development course. Aloha Apparel Co is a clothing line that we are instructed to 
create a homepage for using the tools we have learned. This is the second week project that included more complex sections in the page.

###Tools and Methods Used
+ HTML and CSS - for the content and layout of the webpage
+ Flexbox - for vertical layout of certain sections of the webpage. It is used on the header and the product categories grid.
+ jQuery - used for smooth scrolling from the navigation menu to sections of the webpage
+ Flickity - it is seen in the most-loved section of the page that features all the products in a horizontal slider

###General Objectives Achieved
We learned how to use HTML as the content layer of the webpage and use CSS to modify the content layout. We had originally used floats to position certain sections and elements of the webpage, but in the second week, we were taught how to use Flexbox instead. Within two week, I had to update the webpage from using floats to flexboxes to position different categories into a grid.

We were also introduced to JavaScript and jQuery plugins which we used to control the smooth scrolling from the navigation list to the selected section. On the webpage, we also had to implement an alert that displays when the user decides to subscribe to the clothing line newsletter. If the email address was not a valid string input, a pop up will remind user to enter a valid address. Once a valid address has been submitted, a pop up will confirm that the email was added to subscription. 

The structure of the page using CSS was a little challenging for me as there are a magnitude of CSS properties out there and learning how to use each relevant one was difficult. However, at the end of this two weeks project, I fully understand how to manipulate the background property using images and positions, how to implement web-fonts and other font-icons properly, and in general how to manipulate the size of all HTML elements to make the page responsive to different screen media sizes.

Overall, this project was a great start on learning how to fully utilize HTML and CSS to shape a webpage and a decent introduction into the world of JavaScript using jQuery.
